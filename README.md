SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Applied :
HEAT MAP (Generating correlation matrix using Seaborn library)
GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION (Statistics summary of dataset)
PAIRPLOT
DATA MODELLING (training and testing)
Multiple Linear Regression With scikit-learn
Testing the model
Finally showed "PREDICTED SALES GRAPH"
Evaluated the Model (using Mean errors)
Dataset used : "Advertising.csv"
Solved with : Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm
Technologies Used : Python Machine Learning
Python Libraries used :
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
